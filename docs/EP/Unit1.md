## Trajectories of electron in uniform Electric and

Magnetic field (Qualitative)

**1\. Electric Field only:**

- Electrons experience a force **opposite** to the direction of the electric field (due to their negative charge).
- This force causes **acceleration** in the direction opposite to the field.
- The trajectory is a **parabolic path**, with increasing downward curvature as the electron loses kinetic energy due to collisions or radiation.

**2\. Magnetic Field only:**

- Electrons experience a force **perpendicular** to both their velocity and the magnetic field direction (Fleming's left-hand rule).
- This force causes the electron to move in a **circular path**, with the radius inversely proportional to the magnetic field strength.
- Higher field strengths result in tighter circles, while lower strengths lead to wider orbits.

**3\. Combined Electric and Magnetic Fields:**

- When both fields are present, the electron's motion becomes a complex interplay of the two forces.
- The resulting trajectory depends on the relative strengths and directions of the fields.
**4\. Cyclotron Motion:**

- If the electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic field, the electron undergoes a helical motion called **cyclotron motion**.
- The helical path consists of tight circles traced around the direction of the magnetic field, with a superimposed vertical drift due to the electric field.

### Bethe’s law

- The motion of electron beam in non-uniform electric field can be understood by studying Bethe’s law.
- The non uniform electric field is a field in which electric intensity varies from point to point and field lines are not straight and evenly spaced.
- Electron motion in non-uniform electric field is better understood with the help of equipotential surfaces. Equipotential surfaces are those surfaces where electric potential remains constant and electric lines are perpendicular to the surface at any point.
- Therefore the normal to the equipotential surface shows the line of action of electric force on the electron. Let us consider a uniform electric field produced in an infinitesimally thin region. This uniform electric field being set up by two metal plates charged to appropriate potentials.
- The electrons are allowed to pass through the electric field being set up by two closely spaced metal grids as shown in fig.
- Consider an equipotential surface AB. It is considered as the boundary across which the potential V1 abruptly changes to V2. Let an electron travel through the region-I with a uniform velocity v1 and enter the region-II and moves with a velocity v2.
- As the electrons passes through equipotential surface AB it experiences a force which alters its velocity. Because the electric field exists only in the vertical direction (Y-direction). Hence the normal component of electron velocity vy undergoes a change whereas the tangential component vx remains constant.

- The Eqn. (2) is similar to Snell’s law of refraction in optics and is known as Bethe’s law for electron refraction.
- When light enters from rarer to denser medium it gets slowed down and bends towards the normal.
- However when electrons are moving from region of lower potential to region of higher potential gets accelerated and bends toward the normal.

### Electron Lens

An electron lens is an electrical component that focuses an electron beam to a point.

**Principle:**

- A stream of electrons bends at each equipotential surface when it travels through a nonuniform electric field.
- Thus non-uniform electric field can be used to focus or defocus electron rays.
- C.J. Davisson and C.J. Calbick demonstrated in 1931 such optical properties of electrostatic fields.
**Construction / Description:**

- An electrostatic lens consists of two coaxial short cylindrical metal tubes T1 and T2 of same size and separated by small distance.
- They are held at different potentials V1 and V2 respectively such that V2 > V1.
- Electric field does not exist inside the cylindrical metal tubes; however a nonuniform electric field is produced in the gap between the tubes as a result of different potentials applied to the tubes.
- Fig. shows a schematic of a simple electrostatic lens wherein electric field lines and equipotential surfaces are demonstrated.
- The equipotential surfaces are perpendicular to the electric field lines everywhere.

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/762bb7bc-0c58-4bc6-b7b3-fad85b450b07/ad32428c-d6ab-4160-9bf3-8cd1da6f66da/Untitled.png)

**Working:**

- Let us consider a thin bundle of electron rays parallel to the axis and entering the system from the side of the cylindrical metal tube which is at a lower potential V1.
- Electron moving along the axis of the two tubes (shown by position 1) on reaching the equipotential surface, experience an electric force acting along the axis in forward direction so the electrons would be accelerated in forward direction towards tube T2 along the axis and would not deviate from their initial direction of travel.
- The electrons traveling at a distance above the axis (shown by position 2) on reaching the convex equipotential surface in the gap experience electrostatic force F acting at an angle to the direction of their motion.
- This force F experienced by the electrons at the convex equipotential surface can be resolved in to two rectangular components; F l l parallel to the axis and F┴ perpendicular to the axis of the tube.
- The action of the Fll component is to accelerate the electrons along the axial direction. These electrons would be acted upon by F┴ component and get deflected towards the axis and are also simultaneously accelerated toward tube T2 due to the force component F l l.
- Similarly electrons moving below the axis (shown by position 3) are deflected upward towards the axis and are accelerated in forward direction. Thus all the off axis electron paths around the axis tend to converge toward the axis.
- However on crossing the midplane MM’ of the gap, the converging electron rays encounter equipotential surface of concave shape. In this region the normal component F┴ is directed away from the axis and hence the electrons tend to diverge.
- However the parallel component Fll acts to accelerate the electrons further in the direction parallel to the axis.
- Similarly electrons traveling at a distance below the axis of the tube would be deflected towards the axis in the first half of the gap and deflected away from the axis in the second half of the gap and the net result is that the field between T1 and the midplane MM’ converges the electron beam like a convex lens while the field between the midplane MM’ and T2 diverges the electron beam like a concave lens.
- The electrons spends a greater time in the first half of the gap as it travels slower and the impulse ‘Fll t’ is greater for the convergence interval. In the second half the electrons move faster and spends less time and the impulse ‘F l l t’ is smaller for the divergence interval.
- Consequently , the electrons rays are less diverged by the second half than converged by the first half of the gap. Therefore the converging action of the first half of the gap will be stronger than diverging action of the second half of the gap and the electron ray emerge from T2 will be sufficiently convergent as shown in fig.

### Devices- Electron microscope

An electron microscope is defined as the type of microscope in which the source of illumination is the beam of accelerated electrons. It is a special type of microscope with a high resolution of images as the images can be magnified in nanometers.

There are two types of electron microscopes:

- The transmission electron microscope (TEM)
- The scanning electron microscope (SEM)

### **Principle of Electron Microscope**

- The metal used in an electron microscope is tungsten.
- A high voltage current is applied which results in the excitation of the electrons in the form of a continuous stream that is used as a beam of light.
- The lenses used in the electron microscope are magnetic coils.
- These magnetic coils are capable of focusing the electron beam on the sample such that the sample gets illuminated.
- As the flow of current increases, the strength of the magnetic lens increases.
- The electron beam flow is designed such that it cannot pass through the glass lens.

### **Application of Electron Microscope**

- Quality control and failure analysis in industries are done with the help of an electron microscope.
- The images obtained in an electron microscope can be captured as electron micrographs with the help of specialized cameras.
- The study of metals and crystals became easy with the introduction of an electron microscope.

### (CRO) Cathode Ray Oscilloscope

**Cathode Ray Oscilloscope** is a very important electronic measuring instrument which is used to display and measure electrical signals, time intervals and phase shift between two electrical signals. Non electrical quantities such as pressure, strain and temperature can be measured by first converting them into an equivalent voltage using an appropriate transducer. Any CRO basically consists of the following seven major sections **i) Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) ii) Time base circuits iii) Trigger circuits iv) Vertical Circuits v) Horizontal Circuits vi) High Voltage Power Supply vii) Low Voltage Power Supply**
