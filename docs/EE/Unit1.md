**4. Active Listening**: While one participant speaks, others in the circle are encouraged to actively listen without interrupting. Active listening involves maintaining eye contact, nodding in acknowledgment, and refraining from side conversations, demonstrating respect and attentiveness towards the speaker.

**5. Language Practice**: In an English for Engineers class, the Circle Activity serves as a language practice exercise, providing participants with opportunities to communicate in English within a supportive and non-threatening environment. Participants can practice expressing themselves fluently, articulating their thoughts, and using technical vocabulary relevant to their field of study or profession.

**6. Building Connections**: Through sharing personal information and listening to others' contributions, participants begin to establish connections and find commonalities with their peers. This process helps to break down barriers, foster camaraderie, and create a sense of belonging within the group.

**7.Facilitator's Role**: The facilitator plays a crucial role in guiding the activity, ensuring that it remains focused, inclusive, and conducive to positive interaction. They may intervene if necessary to encourage quieter participants to speak or to redirect the discussion back to the prompt.

**8. Reflection and Debriefing**: After the Circle Activity concludes, the facilitator may lead a brief reflection or debriefing session to allow participants to share their thoughts and experiences. This reflection period provides an opportunity for self-awareness, feedback, and further bonding among group members.
