- Write the quotient (0) in the units place of the top row.

**4. Shifting and Subtraction:**

- Shift the dividend one place to the right, bringing the 3 under the tens place of the divisor.
- Subtract the product of the divisor and the quotient (0 x 12) from the current digit (3). In this case, the difference remains 3.

**5. Borrowing and Iteration:**

- If the difference obtained in step 4 is less than the divisor, borrow 10 from the next digit of the dividend (virtually adding 100 to the current difference).
- Update the current difference with the borrowed value. In this case, the difference becomes 13 (3 + 10).
- Divide the updated difference by the divisor (13 / 12). This gives a quotient of 1 with a remainder of 1.
- Write the quotient (1) in the tens place of the top row and the remainder (1) below the current digit.

**6. Repeat and Complete:**

- Continue the process of shifting, subtracting/borrowing, dividing, and writing quotients/remainders for subsequent digits of the dividend.
- Stop when all digits are processed, and the final remainder is 0.

**7. Result and Interpretation:**

- Reading the top row from right to left gives the quotient: 61.
- Therefore, 732 ÷ 12 = 61.
