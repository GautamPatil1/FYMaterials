# **Unit IV Bhartiya Beej Ganitam (Algebra)**

## L.C.M , H.C.F

**1. L.C.M. using Anupurvi Sutra:**

- This sutra translates to "following the order."
- Arrange the given numbers in descending order.
- Multiply the largest number by 1, then 2, then 3, and so on, checking if the product is divisible by all other numbers.
- The first product divisible by all numbers is the L.C.M.

**2. Example:** Find the L.C.M. of 12, 18, and 24.

- Arrange: 24, 18, 12
- 24 x 1 (not divisible by 18)
- 24 x 2 (not divisible by 18)
- 24 x 3 (divisible by 18 and 12)

Therefore, the L.C.M. of 12, 18, and 24 is 72.

**3. H.C.F. using Niyata Sutra:**

- This sutra translates to "fixed."
- Find the prime factorization of each number.
- Identify the common prime factors present in all numbers with the lowest power for each factor.
- Multiply the identified common factors with their lowest powers to obtain the H.C.F.

**4. Example:** Find the H.C.F. of 12, 18, and 24.

- Prime factorization: 12 = 2² x 3, 18 = 2 x 3², 24 = 2³ x 3
- Common factors: 2 and 3
- Lowest powers: 2¹ and 3¹
- H.C.F. = 2¹ x 3¹ = 6

**5. Advantages:**

- These methods can be visually intuitive and conceptually simple, especially for smaller numbers.
- They often involve fewer steps compared to standard L.C.M. and H.C.F. algorithms for specific cases.

**6. Limitations:**

- Anupurvi Sutra might require more calculations for larger sets of numbers due to repeated multiplication.
- Niyata Sutra requires understanding prime factorization, which might not be suitable for all age groups.

**7. Applicability:**

These methods can be applied to find L.C.M. and H.C.F. of any whole numbers.

**8. Cultural Significance:**

Bhartiya Beej Ganitam's methods showcase the ingenuity and practicality of traditional Indian mathematics, offering alternative approaches to common calculations.

**9. Integration with Vedic Maths:**

Certain Vedic techniques like factorization methods can complement Niyata Sutra for efficient prime factorization.

**10. Exploration and Continued Learning:**

Exploring diverse methods for L.C.M. and H.C.F. can enhance problem-solving skills and mathematical understanding. Remember, Bhartiya Beej Ganitam offers valuable insights into the rich tapestry of Indian mathematical traditions.

### Algebra – ( linear equation Type -1,2,3)

**1. Type 1 Equations: Simple Linear Equations:**

- These equations involve one variable and constants, expressed as ax + b = c.
- Bhartiya Beej Ganitam utilizes its core multiplication techniques to manipulate the equation and isolate the variable.

**2. Example:** Solve for x in 3x + 5 = 14.

- Subtract 5 from both sides: 3x = 9.
- Divide both sides by 3: x = 3.

**3. Type 2 Equations: Simultaneous Linear Equations:**

- These involve two equations with two variables, often represented as ax + by = c and dx + ey = f.
- Bhartiya Beej Ganitam employs methods like elimination or substitution, adapted to leverage its multiplication techniques.

**4. Example:** Solve for x and y in 2x + 3y = 11 and 4x - y = 7.

- Multiply the second equation by 3: 12x - 3y = 21.
- Add the modified second equation to the first: 14x = 32.
- Divide both sides by 14: x = 2.
- Substitute 2 for x in the first equation: 4 + 3y = 11.
- Solve for y: 3y = 7; y = 7/3.

**5. Type 3 Equations: Quadratic Equations:**

- These involve equations of the form ax² + bx + c = 0.
- While Bhartiya Beej Ganitam doesn't offer a direct formula for quadratic solutions, it provides techniques for simplifying and manipulating quadratic expressions.

**6. Example:** Factor the quadratic equation x² - 5x + 6 = 0.

- Using knowledge of multiplication patterns, identify factors of 6 that add up to -5: -3 and -2.
- Rewrite the equation as (x - 3)(x - 2) = 0.
- Therefore, the solutions are x = 3 and x = 2.

**7. Advantages:**

- Bhartiya Beej Ganitam's methods can be visually intuitive and conceptually simple for specific types of equations.
- They often emphasize manipulation and transformation, promoting deeper understanding of algebraic concepts.

**8. Limitations:**

- These methods might not be directly applicable to all types of equations or complex systems.
- Understanding multiplication patterns and factorization plays a crucial role.

**9. Cultural Significance:**

Bhartiya Beej Ganitam's approach to algebra reflects its unique perspective on manipulating numbers and relationships, enriching the tapestry of mathematical traditions.

**10. Further Exploration:**

Exploring variations and adaptations of these methods within Bhartiya Beej Ganitam and integrating them with other mathematical systems can be a rewarding journey for those seeking diverse problem-solving approaches.

### Average (Consecutive No , Consecutive odd no ,Consecutive even No , Table of any digit )

**1. Consecutive Numbers:**

- To find the average of n consecutive numbers (a, a + 1, ..., a + n - 1), Bhartiya Beej Ganitam utilizes the formula: (a + a + n - 1) / 2.

**2. Example:** Find the average of the first 5 natural numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

- Apply the formula: (1 + 5) / 2 = 3.

**3. Consecutive Odd Numbers:**

- For consecutive odd numbers (a, a + 2, ..., a + 2(n - 1)), the average is calculated as: (a + a + 2(n - 1)) / 2.

**4. Example:** Find the average of the first 4 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7).

- Apply the formula: (1 + 7) / 2 = 4.

**5. Consecutive Even Numbers:**

- For consecutive even numbers (a, a + 2, ..., a + 2(n - 1)), the average is: (a + a + 2(n - 1)) / 2. Note that the result will always be an even number.

**6. Example:** Find the average of the first 5 even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10).

- Apply the formula: (2 + 10) / 2 = 6.

**7. Table of a Single Digit:**

- To find the average of a table filled with the same single digit (e.g., a table filled only with 5s), simply use the digit itself as the average.

**8. Example:** Find the average of a 3x3 table filled with only 7s.

- The average is simply 7.

**9. Advantages:**

- These methods are quick, efficient, and require minimal calculations for specific sets of numbers.
- They leverage the core multiplication principles of Bhartiya Beej Ganitam.

**10. Limitations:**

- These formulas are not directly applicable to all types of sets or distributions.
- Understanding the underlying logic and pattern recognition is crucial for effective application.
