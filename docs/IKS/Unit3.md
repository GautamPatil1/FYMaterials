# **Unit III Square Roots using Vedic Maths**

## Square

**1. Urdhva Tiryakbhyam Sutra:**

This central sutra translates to "vertically and diagonally," and forms the basis for various squaring methods.

**2. Squaring Single-Digit Numbers:**

- For single-digit numbers (1-9), the square can be directly obtained by multiplying the digit by itself and adding 1 (if the digit is greater than 4).

**3. Example 1:** 5² = 5 x 5 + 1 = 26

**4. Squaring Double-Digit Numbers:**

- Decompose the two-digit number into tens and units place digits (a and b).
- The square can be calculated using the formula: a² + 2ab + b²

**5. Example 2:** 23² = (2)² + 2(2)(3) + (3)² = 4 + 12 + 9 = 25

**6. Explanation of the Formula:**

- (a²): Square of the tens digit.
- 2ab: Double product of the tens and units digits.
- (b²): Square of the units digit.

**7. Squaring Numbers Ending in 5:**

- For numbers ending in 5 (like 25, 35, etc.), the square can be easily obtained by manipulating the tens digit and adding 25.

**8. Example 3:** 35² = (30 + 5)² = 30² + 2(30)(5) + 5² = 900 + 300 + 25 = 1225

**9. Squaring Numbers Ending in 0:**

- For numbers ending in 0 (like 20, 40, etc.), the square is simply the square of the tens digit appended with two zeros.

**10. Example 4:** 40² = (4)²00 = 1600

These are just a few examples, and Vedic Mathematics offers various squaring techniques depending on the specific number and desired level of efficiency. Exploring these methods can be a fascinating journey, revealing the unique and elegant approaches to calculations developed by ancient Indian mathematicians.

### Starting with 5 ending with 5, base method

**1. Identifying the Pattern:**

The key principle lies in recognizing the pattern that emerges when multiplying numbers with the same leading and trailing digits (e.g., 55, 65, 75, etc.).

**2. Choosing the Base:**

- Select the larger digit within the given number as the base (here, it's 5).
- Double the base (10 in this case).

**3. Adding the Smaller Digit:**

- Add the smaller digit of the given number to the doubled base (10 + 5 = 15).

**4. Halving the Sum:**

- Divide the sum obtained in step 3 by 2 (15 / 2 = 7.5).

**5. Interpretation and Result:**

- Discard the decimal part, and the remaining whole number represents the product's tens digit. In this case, the tens digit is 7.

**6. Finding the Units Digit:**

- Multiply the original number's digits (5 and 5) directly (5 x 5 = 25).
- Take the last two digits of the product as the units digit of the final answer (25, so the units digit is 25).

**7. Combining the Digits:**

- Combine the obtained tens and units digits to form the final product. Here, it's 725.

**8. Example:**

Therefore, 55 x 55 = 725.

**9. Advantages:**

- The Base Method offers a quick and efficient way to multiply numbers with the same leading and trailing digits, requiring fewer steps compared to standard multiplication methods for these specific cases.
- It promotes understanding of place value manipulation and mental calculations.

**10. Applicability:**

This method works for any two-digit numbers that begin and end with the same digit, not just multiples of 5.

Remember, the Base Method is just one of many fascinating techniques within Vedic Mathematics. Exploring this method alongside others can be a rewarding experience, revealing the elegance and practicality of traditional Indian arithmetic systems.

### Square root

**1. Urdhva Tiryakbhyam Sutra:**

This core sutra, translating to "vertically and diagonally," guides various Vedic calculations, including square root extraction.

**2. Squaring Pattern Recognition:**

Understanding the pattern of squares formed by consecutive numbers is crucial for this method.

**3. Example Pattern:**

- 1² = 1
- 2² = 4 (formed by adding 3 to 1²)
- 3² = 9 (formed by adding 5 to 4²)
- 4² = 16 (formed by adding 7 to 9²)

**4. Identifying Pairs:**

The method involves grouping digits in pairs, starting from the rightmost pair.

**5. Largest Perfect Square Identification:**

Within each pair, identify the largest perfect square (square of an integer) less than or equal to the pair's value.

**6. Digit Extraction and Adjustment:**

- Extract the digit corresponding to the identified perfect square's root as the first digit of the square root.
- Subtract the identified perfect square from the pair and bring the next digit from the original number to form a new pair.

**7. Iteration and Completion:**

- Repeat steps 5 and 6 for subsequent pairs, adjusting the identified perfect square based on the updated pair value.
- Continue until all digits are processed, and the final remainder becomes 0.

**8. Example: Find the square root of 225:**

- Group digits: 22, 5
- Largest perfect square in 22 is 16 (4²): Extract 4 as the first digit of the square root (√225 starts with 4).
- Subtract 16 from 22: 6; Bring next digit (5) to form 65.
- Largest perfect square in 65 is 49 (7²): Extract 7 as the second digit.
- Subtract 49 from 65: 16; No further digits, remainder 0.

**9. Result and Interpretation:**

Therefore, √225 = 47

**10. Advantages:**

- Vedic square root extraction can be faster and more efficient compared to the long division method for specific numbers.

- 2³ = 8 (formed by adding 7 to 1³)
- 3³ = 27 (formed by adding 19 to 8³)
- 4³ = 64 (formed by adding 37 to 27³)

**4. Identifying Groups:**

The method involves grouping digits in threes, starting from the rightmost triplet.

**5. Largest Perfect Cube Identification:**

Within each triplet, identify the largest perfect cube (cube of an integer) less than or equal to the triplet's value.

**6. Digit Extraction and Adjustment:**

- Extract the digit corresponding to the identified perfect cube's root as the first digit of the cube root.
- Subtract the identified perfect cube from the triplet and bring the next three digits from the original number to form a new triplet.

**7. Iteration and Completion:**

- Repeat steps 5 and 6 for subsequent triplets, adjusting the identified perfect cube based on the updated triplet value.
- Continue until all digits are processed, and the final remainder becomes 0.

**8. Example: Find the cube of 342:**

- Group digits: 034, 2
- Largest perfect cube in 034 is 27 (3³): Extract 3 as the first digit of the cube root (∛342 starts with 3).
- Subtract 27 from 034: 07; Bring next three digits (42) to form 0742.
- Largest perfect cube in 0742 is 729 (9³): Extract 9 as the second digit.
- Subtract 729 from 0742: 13; No further digits, remainder 0.

**9. Result and Interpretation:**

Therefore, ∛342 = 39

**10. Advantages:**

- Vedic cubing can be faster and more efficient compared to the standard power of three method for specific numbers.
- It promotes mental calculations and understanding of number patterns.

### Cubes root [Starting with –1, ending with –1, same No. ]

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

The key lies in understanding the pattern formed when cubing odd numbers, particularly those with alternating positive and negative signs.

**2. Alternating Sign Pattern:**

- Cubes of consecutive odd numbers alternate between positive and negative values.
- (2n - 1)³ is negative, while (2n + 1)³ is positive for any integer n.

**3. Example Pattern:**

- (-1)³ = -1
- 1³ = 1
- (-3)³ = -27
- 3³ = 27

**4. Identifying the Base:**
