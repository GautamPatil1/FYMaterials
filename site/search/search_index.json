Equipotential surfaces are those surfaces where electric potential remains constant and electric lines are perpendicular to the surface at any point.</li> <li>Therefore the normal to the equipotential surface shows the line of action of electric force on the electron. Let us consider a uniform electric field produced in an infinitesimally thin region. This uniform electric field being set up by two metal plates charged to appropriate potentials.</li> <li>The electrons are allowed to pass through the electric field being set up by two closely spaced metal grids as shown in fig.</li> <li>Consider an equipotential surface AB. It is considered as the boundary across which the potential V1 abruptly changes to V2. Let an electron travel through the region-I with a uniform velocity v1 and enter the region-II and moves with a velocity v2.</li> <li>As the electrons passes through equipotential surface AB it experiences a force which alters its velocity. Because the electric field exists only in the vertical direction (Y-direction). Hence the normal component of electron velocity vy undergoes a change whereas the tangential component vx remains constant.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The Eqn. (2) is similar to Snell\u2019s law of refraction in optics and is known as Bethe\u2019s law for electron refraction.</li> <li>When light enters from rarer to denser medium it gets slowed down and bends towards the normal.</li> <li>However when electrons are moving from region of lower potential to region of higher potential gets accelerated and bends toward the normal.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"EP/Unit1/#electron-lens","title":"Electron Lens","text":"<p>An electron lens is an electrical component that focuses an electron beam to a point.</p> <p>Principle:</p> <ul> <li>A stream of electrons bends at each equipotential surface when it travels through a nonuniform electric field.</li> <li>Thus non-uniform electric field can be used to focus or defocus electron rays.</li> <li> <p>C.J. Davisson and C.J. Calbick demonstrated in 1931 such optical properties of electrostatic fields. Construction / Description:</p> </li> <li> <p>An electrostatic lens consists of two coaxial short cylindrical metal tubes T1 and T2 of same size and separated by small distance.</p> </li> <li>They are held at different potentials V1 and V2 respectively such that V2 &gt; V1.</li> <li>Electric field does not exist inside the cylindrical metal tubes; however a nonuniform electric field is produced in the gap between the tubes as a result of different potentials applied to the tubes.</li> <li>Fig. shows a schematic of a simple electrostatic lens wherein electric field lines and equipotential surfaces are demonstrated.</li> <li>The equipotential surfaces are perpendicular to the electric field lines everywhere.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Working:</p> <ul> <li>Let us consider a thin bundle of electron rays parallel to the axis and entering the system from the side of the cylindrical metal tube which is at a lower potential V1.</li> <li>Electron moving along the axis of the two tubes (shown by position 1) on reaching the equipotential surface, experience an electric force acting along the axis in forward direction so the electrons would be accelerated in forward direction towards tube T2 along the axis and would not deviate from their initial direction of travel.</li> <li>The electrons traveling at a distance above the axis (shown by position 2) on reaching the convex equipotential surface in the gap experience electrostatic force F acting at an angle to the direction of their motion.</li> <li>This force F experienced by the electrons at the convex equipotential surface can be resolved in to two rectangular components; F l l parallel to the axis and F\u2534 perpendicular to the axis of the tube.</li> <li>The action of the Fll component is to accelerate the electrons along the axial direction. These electrons would be acted upon by F\u2534 component and get deflected towards the axis and are also simultaneously accelerated toward tube T2 due to the force component F l l.</li> <li>Similarly electrons moving below the axis (shown by position 3) are deflected upward towards the axis and are accelerated in forward direction. Thus all the off axis electron paths around the axis tend to converge toward the axis.</li> <li>However on crossing the midplane MM\u2019 of the gap, the converging electron rays encounter equipotential surface of concave shape. In this region the normal component F\u2534 is directed away from the axis and hence the electrons tend to diverge.</li> <li>However the parallel component Fll acts to accelerate the electrons further in the direction parallel to the axis.</li> <li>Similarly electrons traveling at a distance below the axis of the tube would be deflected towards the axis in the first half of the gap and deflected away from the axis in the second half of the gap and the net result is that the field between T1 and the midplane MM\u2019 converges the electron beam like a convex lens while the field between the midplane MM\u2019 and T2 diverges the electron beam like a concave lens.</li> <li>The electrons spends a greater time in the first half of the gap as it travels slower and the impulse \u2018Fll t\u2019 is greater for the convergence interval. In the second half the electrons move faster and spends less time and the impulse \u2018F l l t\u2019 is smaller for the divergence interval.</li> <li>Consequently , the electrons rays are less diverged by the second half than converged by the first half of the gap.
